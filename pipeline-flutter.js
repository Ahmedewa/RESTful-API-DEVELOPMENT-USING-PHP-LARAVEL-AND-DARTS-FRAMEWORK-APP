FLUTTER APP[CI/CD PIPELINE]


CI/CD Pipelines for Flutter App**

**Step 1: Set Up GitHub Actions**

1. Create a `.github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   name: Flutter CI/CD Pipeline

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v3

         - name: Set up Flutter
           uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
           with:
             flutter-version: 'stable'

         - name: Install dependencies
           run: flutter pub get

         - name: Run tests
           run: flutter test

         - name: Build APK
           run: flutter build apk --release

         - name: Upload APK
           uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
           with:
             name: app-release.apk
             path: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
   ```

2. Trigger the pipeline:
   - Push code to the `main` branch to trigger the workflow.
